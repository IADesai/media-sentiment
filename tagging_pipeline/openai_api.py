For example, the headline, 'RAAC crisis: Sunak defends school record after cowboy-builder jibe" should return the topics "Sunak,Education,Jibe', while the headline 'Sir Gavin Williamson apologises over bullying texts' should return 'Sir Gavin Williamson, Bully, Apologise'.
You should return only one word per topic (famous names are an exception). Between articles, if any words have similar meanings, switch them with one general word to make grouping articles easier. Using this example: "[{3: 'Burger, 'Advert', 'Appearance'}, {4: 'Zoo', 'Panda', 'China'}]", output the words with the corresponding story id for this list of articles: """
